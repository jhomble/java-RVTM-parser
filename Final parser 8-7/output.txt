When required, the technician will create incident reports in order to notify other business teams/units to satisfy user requests.

Technicians will work to solve the problem with the customer when it becomes apparent that Tier I and/or Tier II technicians were unable to discover a solution.

In some instances, the product cannot be salvaged and must be replaced.

Every widget must provide and maintain the IC widget entrance criteria.

(U//FOUO) Some IC SOG user-facing services may be migrated to DTE in some fashion.

Future implementation phases will expand TS/SCI/NOFORN user access to include higher Community of Interest (COI) access control levels for security of data and user accessibility extended into 5-Eyes and TS/Coalition collateral domains.

IC DTE will provide IC users a single set of login credentials to access e-mail, information- sharing databases, desktop video teleconference capabilities, as well as select mission applications, from any desktop in the IC.
